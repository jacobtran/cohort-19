Created by Linus Torvalds in 2005.

## GIT DEMO
### Step 1
```$ git --version```

```$ git init```

```$ git status```

```$ git add -A```

```$ git commit -m "add day 20 files"```

```$ git log```

```$ git log --graph```

```$ git branch```

This will list all the branches of our git repository

```$ git branch -v```

This will give us more details about each branch

```$ git branch <branch_name>```

This will create a new branch with the specified name.  The convention for branch name is:  feature

```$ git checkout <branch_name>```

This is how you switch between branches

```$ git merge <branch_name>```

This will try to merge two branches together.  The branch you are currently in with the branch name you specify in the command.

```$ git branch -D <branch_name>```

To delete a branch

```$ git checkout -b <branch_name>```

To quickly create a branch and move into it
